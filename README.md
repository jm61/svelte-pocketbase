# Svelte/Vite + PocketBase

I used this [template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQuaf9s4vDA&t=623s) as starting point

## PocketBase
[pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) is a database for web apps. It's a simple, fast, and secure database that you can use to build your web app. It's a great alternative to Firebase, and it's free to use.

* no need .env api keys, pocketbase is self hosted
* there is a sample collection to experiment the api with Js sdk
